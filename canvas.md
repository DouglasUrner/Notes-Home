Our class website is on Canvas (students logon by going to https://canvas.instructure.com and signing in with their SKSD Goggle account –  just click on the G icon in the set of six icons at the bottom of the login form).

Canvas is used by all of the Washington state colleges and by many other colleges and training programs, so we’re hoping familiarity with it will help with the transition to college for kids who are heading that way.
