I wanted to check in because I've noticed that your student is missing some assignments and I wanted to see if we could get them back on track before it became overwhelming. I'd also appreciate knowing if there is something that is making school, or my class, challenging for them right not.

In Skyward you will see three "types" of missing assignments:

* An assignment that is just marked as 0 and missing - this means that the student was in class and did not turn in the assignment when it was due.
* An assignment that is also coded as NR - this means that the work was turned in, but needs revision before it can be graded. There will be a note in Skyward that explains how to resubmit the work. Often the note will ask the student to look at Canvas for more detailed feedback.
* An assignment that is coded a G and missing - this means that the student was absent when the assignment was due. These assignments are not marked as 0 until the student has returned to school and has had some time to get caught up.

Many assignments can be resubmitted from home on Canvas, if help is needed a good time to come in is after school on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday. On Tuesdays I am usually in a meeting after school. It is helpful if you or your student can give me a heads up that they are planning to come in so that I don't schedule another meeting...
